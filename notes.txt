phase 1: 6520e30

1. uv init
2. uv venv

uv add flask
create /app
create /app/main.py (hello, world flask == main route)
create Dockerfile


docker build -t resume-agent-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 resume-agent-app


phase 2: 
1. uv add psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
2. create .env with DB stuff
3. create docker-compose.yml

docker volume ls
docker volume inspect postgres_data

When the left side of the volumes: entry isn’t a local path (e.g., . or ./data), Docker treats it as a named volume and automatically creates it under its own storage directory.

So:

Syntax	Type	Where it lives
.:/app	Bind mount	Your local filesystem
./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data	Bind mount	Your local ./data folder
postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data	Named volume	Docker-managed, not visible locally

In short:

No local path on the left side → Docker-managed volume.



in init db we use the same dockerfile as the app. 
In Docker, ENTRYPOINT overrides CMD (or more precisely, it replaces the default command that would otherwise run when the container starts).


docker compose up --build



phase 3
1. npm create vue@latest frontend
only select vue router, ESLint and Prettier. also include example starter code.

src/App.vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <router-view />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
// Empty for now
</script>

<style>
#app {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
</style>


src/views/HomeView.vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello from Vue + Flask!</h1>
    <p>This will soon connect to your Flask backend.</p>
  </div>
</template>

delete:
src/components/
src/assets/logo.svg
src/assets/main.css

add to docker compose
  frontend:
    container_name: resume-agent-frontend
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "5173:5173"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
    environment:
      - VITE_API_BASE=http://flask-app:8080/api
    depends_on:
      - flask-app

In frontend/vite.config.js connects vue to the flask backend:
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: 5173,
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://flask-app:8080',
        changeOrigin: true,
        secure: false,
      },
    },
  },
});

Now any fetch("/api/...") in Vue will reach your Flask app.


- /app/node_modules
That tells Docker:

“Mount my project files from the host, but keep node_modules inside the container.”

Without that, the bind mount ./frontend:/app hides the installed dependencies.




final phase:
assign token count limit for each user.

[owner 19:02:07]: chat tell me a joke
[system 19:02:09]: I’m sorry, but I can’t help with that. I only answer questions related to the candidate’s resume.
[owner 19:02:20]: how bout a joke related to the resume
[system 19:02:21]: Why did the Python code apply to be a professor? Because it heard the professor already had a *script* for teaching and wanted to *compile* a better future for AI agents and NLP!
[owner 19:02:37]: LOL :))
[system 19:02:37]: Glad you liked it! Let me know if you have any other resume‑related questions.
[owner 19:03:04]: note that this is related to the resume. what flaws does the candidate have
[system 19:03:05]: Based on the information that’s actually included in the resume, a few areas might be seen as “flaws” or at least places where the candidate could strengthen the presentation: | Potential flaw | Why it stands out | How it could be improved | |----------------|-------------------|--------------------------| | **Missing specific dates for teaching roles** | All three instructor entries say “None to Present.” That makes it hard to gauge how long the candidate has been teaching each course. | Provide the start month/year for each course (e.g., “Fall 2019 – Present”) so the timeline is clear. | | **Duplicate “National Scholar” entries** | The two NIH roles list the same dates and no distinction in responsibilities. This can look like repetition or a copy‑paste error. | Combine them into one entry that lists both accomplishments, or separate them with distinct dates/roles if they were truly distinct projects. | | **Lack of measurable outcomes for research claims** | Statements such as “Developed a new kind of neural network that is better faster and stronger” are vague and don’t convey concrete impact. | Add metrics (e.g., “Achieved a 15 % speed improvement over baseline models”) or publish‑quality evidence. | | **Very high‑level skill descriptions** | Skills are listed with numeric levels (Javascript 7, Python 10, etc.) but no context about how those skills were applied. | Provide examples of projects or roles where each skill was used (e.g., “Built a Flask‑based web app using Python and JavaScript”). | | **Limited demonstration of collaboration or team‑based work** | All roles are presented individually; no mention of working with cross‑functional teams, mentoring, or leadership. | Highlight any group projects, mentorship, or leadership responsibilities. | | **Absence of non‑technical soft skills** | The resume focuses heavily on technical tasks, with no mention of communication, problem‑solving, or project management skills. | Add a brief section or bullet points illustrating these soft skills (e.g., “Led a 5‑person student team through a capstone project”). | These are not hard “flaws” in the sense of being wrong or untrue, but rather opportunities where the résumé could be clearer, more concise, or more compelling to a hiring manager.
[owner 19:03:37]: thank you
[system 19:03:37]: You’re welcome! If you have any more questions about the resume, feel free to ask.
[owner 19:03:51]: have a nice day
[system 19:03:52]: Thank you! I hope you have a great day as well.
